A convertible bond has an embedded call option that gives bondholders the right to convert their bonds into equity at a given time for a predetermined number of shares in the issuing company. Whereas a reverse convertible bond has an embedded put option that gives the issuer the right to convert the bond's principal into shares of equity at a set date.
